## Key Components

Protection systems comprise:

- **Instrument Transformers (CTs and VTs)**: Scale primary quantities to measurable levels
- **Relays**: Detect faults and initiate trip commands (electromechanical, static, and numerical types)
- **Circuit Breakers**: Execute isolation of the faulty element with rapid switching capability
- **Communication Systems**: Coordinate protection over distances using protocols like IEC 61850 GOOSE messages
- **Auxiliary Power Supplies**: Ensure relays and breakers operate during faults
- **Monitoring and Diagnostic Tools**: Record disturbances and assist in post-event analysis

## Historical Context

Electric power systems evolved from small-scale, localised networks into vast interconnected grids. Early systems faced challenges in managing faults, which led to equipment damage and service interruptions. As the systems expanded and voltages increased, more sophisticated protection techniques were required.

The development of the transformer enabled long-distance high-voltage transmission, which in turn required reliable protection mechanisms to deal with new fault conditions. The early work of pioneers like William Stanley and the installation of the first transformer-based AC system in 1886 laid the foundation for modern power system protection.

The introduction of differential protection, impedance-based relays, and eventually digital relays has revolutionised fault detection, making protection systems more intelligent and adaptive.

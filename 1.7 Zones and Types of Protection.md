## Zones and Types of Protection

Protection zones are defined to ensure complete system coverage:

- **Generator Protection**: Against stator and rotor faults, loss of excitation, unbalanced loads, etc
- **Transformer Protection**: Differential, Buchholz relay, overpressure, thermal
- **Line Protection**: Overcurrent, distance, pilot wire, and directional comparison schemes
- **Busbar Protection**: High-speed differential or low-impedance busbar relays
- **Motor and Feeder Protection**: Thermal overload, stall protection, phase unbalance, short circuit

Each zone may employ a different combination of primary and backup protection, and use either unit or non-unit protection schemes.

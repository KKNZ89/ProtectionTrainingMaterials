## Role in Modern Power Systems

In todayâ€™s power systems, protection schemes are indispensable. They ensure:

- Faults are cleared quickly to avoid cascading failures
- Equipment operates within safe limits
- Operational safety for maintenance personnel
- Economic operation by minimizing damage and service interruptions

In interconnected power networks, protection systems help prevent loss of synchronism among generators and maintain voltage stability. They also assist in grid code compliance and grid interconnection standards, especially in regions integrating renewable energy sources.

## Purpose and Objectives

The primary purpose of protection systems is to:

- Detect abnormal operating conditions such as faults or overloads
- Isolate the affected section with minimal disruption
- Prevent damage to equipment and ensure personnel safety
- Maintain system stability and continuity of supply
- Fulfill legal and regulatory requirements

These objectives must be achieved with high speed, accuracy, and reliability. The effectiveness of a protection scheme is often evaluated in terms of its dependability and security.

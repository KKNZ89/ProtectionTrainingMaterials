## Overview of Power System Protection

Power system protection is a critical discipline within electrical engineering aimed at safeguarding the various components of the electric power system: generators, transformers, transmission lines, distribution systems, and more. It ensures the stability, safety, and reliability of electrical power delivery by isolating faulty sections during abnormal conditions.

A well-designed protection system is essential for preventing extensive equipment damage and ensuring safe operational conditions. It acts as the backbone of grid resilience by maintaining continuous service despite faults or disturbances.
